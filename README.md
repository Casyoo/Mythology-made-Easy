## Project Title
Mythology-made-Easy

## Description 

Mythology-made-Easy's purpose is to serve as a quick and simple reference for things mythological. 
It has the added functiionality of a "save for late" page where images from the index page can be saved (local storage).
At this stage in development it does contain comment functionality (local storage) and a contact form(not opperational).


## Table of contents

### How to run the project
  * By running the index.html file you should be able to access the "site".
  * Use Chrome if able - the site was thusfar only tested and written for Chrome.


### Content and Instructions relating to use of the project
  * Index page - Content:  
    1. The About section
    2. Three relevant sections for 6 continents (Africa and Europe, Asia and Oceania, The Americas).
    3. Two cards per section containing an image and dummy caption for each.
       Each image has two icons in the upper left corner - a heart (purely cosmetic) and a save (saves image to local              storage and displays it in Saved for Later page) icon. 
    4. A table where the information is displayed.
  * Comment/Contact - Content: 
    1.  Contact the author Section (a form) with contact form, a subscribtion to newsletter form, and an interests section.         (Not currently operational).
    2.  Feedback and comments form wher a name and comment can be saved to local storage and displayed.
    3.  Saved Items page where images "saved" on index page will be displayed (alt and url). 

### Roadmap/Future Features
  This is a labour-of-love kind of project, and the following will hopefully be added:
    * More information contained in the tables.
    * Different images cycling instead of static cards.
    * A working contact form.
